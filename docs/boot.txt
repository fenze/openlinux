BOOT
====

Openlinux for now supports only uefi based booting.
Kernel bzImage must have efi stub (1) option enabled, 
and placed in correct path (2). The uefi starts image,
kernel does it startup procedures, then mounts our initrd (3),
and parses bootconfig.txt (3), next init (4) is called.
Init program mounts kernel virtual filesystems and switches to real root partition, then
runs real init system.
