        help
            Select this option to use the LLVM/Clang toolchain
            for building the system instead of GCC.

        bool "Compile the system with -Werror"

	  If you select this option, all compiler warnings will be treated as errors.

	default y
	help
	  Enable this option to include debugging symbols and additional debug information in the build.

    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_O0
    	bool "No optimization (-O0)"
    	help
    		Compile the system without any optimization.
    		This is useful for debugging but results in
    		slower binaries.
    
    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_G
    	bool "Optimize for debugging (-Og)"
    	help
    		Compile the system with optimizations that
    		are compatible with debugging, providing a
    		balance between performance and debuggability.
    
    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_O1
    	bool "Optimize for size and speed (-O1)"
    	help
    		Compile the system with basic optimizations
    		that improve performance without significantly
    		increasing compile time.
    
    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_O2
    	bool "Optimize for speed (-O2)"
    	help
    		Compile the system with optimizations that
    		improve execution speed. This is a good
    		balance between performance and compile time.
    
    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_O3
    	bool "Optimize for maximum speed (-O3)"
    	help
    		Compile the system with aggressive optimizations
    		that maximize execution speed, potentially at
    		the cost of longer compile times and larger binaries.
    
    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_S
    	bool "Optimize for size (-Os)"
    	help
    		Compile the system with optimizations that
    		reduce binary size, which is useful for
    		resource-constrained environments.
    
    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_Z
    	bool "Optimize for minimum size (-Oz)"
    	help
    		Compile the system with optimizations that
    		focus on minimizing binary size as much as
    		possible, often at the expense of performance.
    
    config OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL_FAST
    	bool "Optimize for maximum speed (Ofast)"
    	depends on LLVM
    	help
    		Compile the system with aggressive optimizations
    		that may violate strict standards compliance
    		to achieve the highest possible performance.
